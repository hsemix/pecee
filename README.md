# [WIP] pecee php framework

**Fast, lightweight, open source MVC PHP framework based on Microsoft MVVM.**

## Demo project

Demo project available here: https://github.com/skipperbent/pecee-project

## Features:

- Fully customisable template engine. Overwrite render() method to add your own templating engine through composer or create your own.

- Every template has class, called a Widget, behind which renders before the view. From here you can set properties, create methods and you can even render widgets inside a widget - this makes it super easy the create small pieces of functionality, that can be reused wherever you like.

- Because every template is basically a class, you can extend functionality from other widgets and reuse the same functionality or overwrite the things you want to change.

- Don't like something? Everything is 100% object oriented, so every little piece of code can be easily extended.
